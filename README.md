# Star Wars App 

## General info
A responsive React.js app that displays Star Wars films and characters short descriptions. Integrated with an external API - https://swapi.dev/.

The website has been built with a mobile-first mindset, but it should work well on all devices. The API data is downloaded only on the initial request and retrieved from local storage when requesting additional information.

## Metrics

I used [LogRocket](https://logrocket.com) for collecting metrics and error tracking. To track this information in your own deployment, you'd have to [set up a LogRocket account](https://docs.logrocket.com/docs/getting-started) and change the `LogRocket.init` line in the `index.js` file to reflect your app ID.
